Philo test
- Do not test with more than 200 philosophers
- - Do not test with time_to_die or time_to_eat or time_to_sleep under 60 ms
- - Test with 1 800 200 200, the philosopher should not eat and should die!
- - Test with 5 800 200 200, no one should die!
- - Test with 5 800 200 200 7, no one should die and the simulation should stop when all the philosopher has eaten atleast 7 times each.
- - Test with 4 410 200 200, no one should die!
- - Test with 4 310 200 100, a philosopher should die!
- - Test with 2 philosophers and check the different times (a death delayed by more than 10 ms is unacceptable).
- - Test with your values to check all the rules. Check if a philosopher dies at the right time if they don't steal forks, etc.
